# River-Monitoring-System

The project involves the approach of the Internet of Things (IoT) which will be done  using a microcontroller. 
We are using customized sensorâ€™s node for monitoring the  parameters of water like pH, turbidity, 
temperature, oxidation-reduction potential,  Dissolved Oxygen, industrial wastes, hospital waste etc. 
The information is going to be  level-headed constantly and this information will be consigned to the database 
on any  municipal corporation website database and authorized person can access it and find 
possible solution for that problem.


If you want any material(like presentation or prototype) about it, then contact me.
